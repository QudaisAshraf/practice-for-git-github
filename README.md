# Welcome to My GitHub Repository

Hi everyone, this is Qudais Ashraf!

I have recently learned about Git and GitHub concepts, including the processes of cloning and forking projects. 

In this repository, I cloned the **Python Master Class** repository from **Shubham Londhe** and added two new files:
1. **README.md** - This file you are reading.
2. **new_file.txt** - An additional file I created.

Additionally, I created a new branch named **qudais** where I made another file called **file-qudais.txt** I then merged this branch with the master class branch to integrate my changes.

Feel free to explore the repository and check out the changes!
